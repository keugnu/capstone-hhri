Node:	tracker (Motion to follow object around robot)
Input:
	struct proximity[] 	// three IR sensors (left, right, center)
Config:
	max proximity: 100cm
Output:
	None
Steps:
	Initialization: Begin subscribing to tpc_tracker (10Hz)
	1. 	if proximity from all sensors is not max, then (a person is in view)
			(a) Position the head so that the center sensor is < max and left and right is >= max
			(b) begin tracking loop
				if right sensor proximity < max and ~= center proximity, then
					(a) make request to srv_track (+5 degrees)
				else if left sensor proximity < max and ~= center proximity, then
					(a) make request to srv_track (-5 degrees)
				else if all sensors are >= max
					(a) make request to srv_track (90)
					(b)	break
