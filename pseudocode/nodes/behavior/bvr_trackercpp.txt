Node:	tracker (Motion to follow object around robot)
Input:
	Data (float from each IR sensor, representing distance in cm)
Output:
	Data to the servo controller to move head towards object
Steps:
	Initialization: center head on body (servo moves head to face front and center).
	Begin subscribing to tpc_tracker (5Hz) (both right and left)
	2. if float from left IR sensor is less than 200cm and float from right IR sensor 
	greater than or equal to 200cm then:
		(a) return data to turn head left.
	3. else if float from right IR sensor is less than 200cm and float from left IR sensor 
	greater than or equal to 200cm then:
		(a) return data to turn head right.
	4. else if float from left and right IR sensors is less than 200cm and float from
	left IR sensor is less than float from right IR sensor then:
		(a) return data to turn head left.
	5. else if float from left and right IR sensors is less than 200cm and float from
	right IR sensor is less than float from left IR sensor then:
		(a) return data to turn head right.
