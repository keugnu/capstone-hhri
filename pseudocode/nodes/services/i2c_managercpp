Node:	i2c_manager
Input:
	signed char[] request
Config:
	request	:	request[0] 		type (1: write|0: read)
			request[1-8]		register 1
			request[9-16]		byte to write if type=1 o/w 0
Output:
	bool success
	signed char[] data
Steps:
	1. 	Initialization: Check if bus is able to be opened else exit(1)
	2.	Wait for request
	3. 	if request exists, then
		(a) place on request queue
	4.	if queue is not empty
		(a) sort the queue on priority
		(b) serve top request
			(i)	if request is type R, then
					(A) read register(s) in request[] and set data[]
					(B) return data
				elseif write request succeeds, then
					(A) return true
				else:
					(A) increase priority by 1
					(B) place request back onto queue
