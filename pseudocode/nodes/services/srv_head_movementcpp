    Initialization: Wait for service requests
    1.  if a request is received, then
            if request type is T, then
                (a) get current position of the servo by making a request to the I2C Bus Manager (R,addr)
                (b) send request to I2C Bus Manager (W,addr,current+degrees)
                (c) return true
            else
                (a) send request to I2C Bus Manager (W,addr,degrees)
                (b) return true
