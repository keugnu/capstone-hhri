Node:	mpr121 (Touch Sensor)
Services:
	Client: srv_i2c
Topics:
	Publisher: tpc_touch (rate: 10Hz, size: 5)
Input:
	None
Config:
Output:
	uint8 msg --> tpc_touch
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Create touch topic (tpc_touch) and i2c service (srv_i2c)
	2. Initialize the MPR121 hardware
		(a) Send write requests to srv_i2c to set registers for initialization
		(b) Wait for the initialization to complete
		(c) if the initialization fails, then:
			(i) Shut down the node
	3. Begin loop to read sensor data:
		(a) Send read requests to srv_i2c for measurement of sensors
		(b) Wait for the read requests to complete
		(c) if the read requests succeed, then:
			(i) Publish the sensor data to tpc_touch
		(d) else, continue sending read requests
