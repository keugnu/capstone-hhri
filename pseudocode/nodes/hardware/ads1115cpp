Node:	ads1115 (I2C ADC)
Services:
	Client: srv_i2c
Topics:
	Publisher: tpc_adc (rate: 2Hz, size: 5)
Input:
	None
Config:
	include ADS1115.h
Output:
	int16 adc[5] --> tpc_adc
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Create tpc_adc
	2. Begin 2Hz loop reading ADS1115 data
		(a) Send request to srv_i2c for reading on all channels (0-3)
		(b) Wait for status of the read request to be complete
		(c) if the read request was successful, then:
			(i) Publish measurement to tpc_adc
		(d) else continue loop
