Node:	mcp9808 (Temperature Sensor)
Services:
	Client: srv_i2c
	Server: srv_temp
Input:
	None
Config:
	DATA CONVERSION:
		celsius --> (data[0] & 0x1F) * 256 + data[1] 
		farenheight --> celsius * 0.0625 * 1.8 + 32;
Output:
	float32 data
	bool success
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Create temperature service (srv_temp)
	2. Wait for service requests
		(a) if a service request exists, then:
			(i) Create srv_i2c client
			(ii) Send a read request to srv_i2c to read current temperature
			(iii) Wait for the read request to be complete
			(iv) if the read request was successful, then:
				(1) return the measurement from the sensor in farenheight with success (response.data, response.success)
			(v) else, return unsuccessful (response.success)
