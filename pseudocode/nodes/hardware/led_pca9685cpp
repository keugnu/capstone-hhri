Node:	led_pca9685 (LED driver)
Input:
	String color ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
Config:
	uint8 address
Output:
	uint16 pwm_freq_r (to control red light)
	uint16 pwm_freq_g (to control green light)
	uint16 pwm_freq_b (to control blue light)
Steps:
	1. 	Initialization: Send write request to I2C bus manager node
			(a) Set LEDs to off by setting pwm_freq_r, pwm_freq_g, pwm_freq_b to 0.0
	2. 	Subscribe to tpc_colors (2Hz)
	3. 	if a change is detected on tpc_colors then
			(a) Send write request to I2C bus manager node
				(i) 	if color is "red" then pwm_freq_r = 4096, pwm_freq_g = 0, pwm_freq_b = 0
				(ii) 	if color is "blue" then pwm_freq_r = 0, pwm_freq_g = 0, pwm_freq_b = 4096
				(ii) 	if color is "yellow" then pwm_freq_r = 4096, pwm_freq_g = 819, pwm_freq_b = 0
