Node:	pca9685_led_pub (LED driver)
Input:
	String color // "red" "blue" "yellow"
Config:
	int16 address
Output:
	uint16 pwm_freq_r (to control red light)
	uint16 pwm_freq_g (to control green light)
	uint16 pwm_freq_b (to control blue light)
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Send write request to I2C bus manager node
		(a)Set LEDs to off by setting pwm_freq_r, pwm_freq_g, pwm_freq_b to 0.0
	2. Subscribe to tpc_colors
	3. if a change is detected on tpc_colors then
		(a) Send write request to I2C bus manager node
			(i) if color is "red" then pwm_freq_r = 1.0, pwm_freq_g = 0.0, pwm_freq_b = 0.0
			(ii) if color is "blue" then pwm_freq_r = 0.0, pwm_freq_g = 0.0, pwm_freq_b = 1.0
			(ii) if color is "yellow" then pwm_freq_r = 1.0, pwm_freq_g = 0.2, pwm_freq_b = 0.0
