Node:	vl53l0x (IR Laser TOF Proximity Sensor)
Services:
	Client: srv_i2c
Topics:
	Publisher: tpc_track (rate: 5Hz, size: 10)
Input:
	None
Config:
Output:
	center, left, right --> tpc_track
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Create tracking topic (tpc_track) and i2c service client (srv_i2c)
	2. Begin initializaiton of VL53L0X sensors
		(a) Send write requests to srv_i2c to set registers for initializaiton
		(b) if the initializaiton fails, then:
			(i) Shut down the node
	3. Begin loop (5Hz) to publish sensor data to tpc_track:
		(a) Send read requets to srv_i2c for each VL53L0X
		(b) Wait for the read requests to complete
		(c) if the read requests succeed, then:
			(i) if center sensor data is less than 10, then:
				(1) Publish center as 8190 to tpc_track
			(ii) else, publish center sensor data to tpc_track
			(ii) Publish right and left to tpc_track, respectively
		(d) Continue loop to read VL53L0X data
