Node:	zxgesture (Gesture sensor)
Services:
	Client: srv_i2c
Topics:
	Publisher: tpc_wave (rate: 10Hz, size: 5)
Input:
	None
Config:
Output:
	uint8 x_pos[3], z_pos[3] --> tpc_wave
Steps:
	1. Initialization: Create wave gesture topic (tpc_wave) and i2c service (srv_i2c)
	2. Create ZX_Gesture object and initialize the hardware with address 0x10:
		(a) Send write requests to srv_i2c for Initialization
		(b) Wait for the write requests to complete
		(c) if the write requests fail, then:
			(i) Shut down the node
		(d) else, begin a loop (10Hz) to read ZX_Gesture data:
			(i) Send read requests to srv_i2c to read ZX_Gesture data
			(ii) Wait for the read requests to complete
			(iii) if the read requests succeed, then:
				(1) Publish ZX_Gesture data to tpc_wave
			(iv) else, continue loop to read ZX_Gesture data
